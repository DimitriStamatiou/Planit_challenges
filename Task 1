Task 1: Determine 10 Test Cases for https://jupitor.cloud.planittesting.com

1. Security: We can try to test any and all inputs for any type of code injection like cross site scripting (XSS) using a local proxy, XSS by just manipulating the text inputs for example inserting an image and attaching an alt statement to it.
2. Checkout: We can try to ping the email server to ensure that it’s up and that it’s actually a real server rather then someone just inputting “a.b.com”
3. Contact: We can replace the word “Forename” with First name because that is a more commonly used term making it easier for the user to read and input their details.
4. Cart: We can round up so the price is only 2 decimal points to make the price more legible for the user
5. Javascript: We can test the javascript to check if it is vulnerable to any Cyber attacks this can be achieved by going through the code with a security checker to ensure top notch security for this e commerce website
6. Performance: Regular performance testing on a whole range of hardware is something that should happen.
7. Usability: Regular usability testing goes a long way to ensure the users aren’t being frustrated with using the website
8. Privacy: Ensuring all cookies get deleted is a must for user privacy and security or better yet, no cookies at all.
9. Security(cart): Testing the cart for any type of forgery is a must for all e commerce websites, especially cross site request forgery (CSRF), SQL Injection (SQLI) and cross site scripting (XSS) as the cart is most likely to be the target to multiple attacks.
10. Cart: Ensuring the items are not stored in the session after they have been removed from the cart is a must when dealing with e commerce websites.
